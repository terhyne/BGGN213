## Level 2 Heading

I can write any *text* (italic) notes for **myself** (bold).

I can insert code (R, Python, etc.) with the **green C button**. I can run the code chunk with the **green play button**. I can **knit** the file to produce an output (html, PDF, etc.).

Example:

```{r}
plot(1:10, col="blue")
```

## Class 6

Today we learned about this and that.

Here's my code:
```{r}
mtcars
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + aes(mpg, disp) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

Here are my notes:

YAY!
